# infobloxapi

Infoblox provides a Perl API (application programming interface) to help facilitate the integration of the Infoblox device into network environments. The Infoblox DMAPI (Data and Management API) is a set of packages delivered with the Infoblox device to install the package. Use the usual Perl module installation tools on your management system to install the package. For Windows systems using the ActiveState build of Perl, the package is called PPM ("Perl Package Manager" or "Programmer's Package Manager"). For UNIX systems, the package is called CPAN, a global archive of Perl resources.
